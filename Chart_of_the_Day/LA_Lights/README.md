The City of Los Angeles is keenly aware of the negative effects of greenhouse gas pollution and is often in the process
of working to counteract the effects of mass individual car ownership by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in other spheres of life.
The Port of Los Angeles for example, was able to reduce the amount of a number of toxic emissions during their
[2005-2012 green campaign](../../LA_Port/README.md). Additionally, the City has begun to retrofit their public lighting infrastructure
with light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs in order to update the traditional incandescent bulbs, which are [shockingly less efficient](https://energy.gov/energysaver/how-energy-efficient-light-bulbs-compare-traditional-incandescents).

The [ChartLab](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab) visualization above, made possible by [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/),
tracks the government's progress with [public data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/citywide-led-streetlight-savings) and
offers insight on the City's latest foray into environmental protectionism. Open the chart with the link above, and use the
