# Route 53 Health Status Alarms

## Overview

This guide describes how to configure email alerts when a URL monitored by Route53 health checks becomes inaccessible. It also provides information on how to enhance the alerts with availability portals and outage details using Axibase Time Series Database [Rule Engine](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/rule-engine/).

## Initial Configuration

1. From the AWS **Console Home** page, navigate to Route53 by opening the **Services** drop-down list in the upper toolbar and clicking **Route53** under the **Networking and Content Delivery** section.

2. Select **Health Checks** from the toolbar on the left and click **Create Health Check**. If you have not set up Route53 services with your AWS account, bypass the introductory screen by clicking **Get started now** under **Avaialability Monitoring**.

3. Configure a new endpoint health check on the form shown below. Specify the **Domain Name** to monitor the status of a specific website and define the path you would like to monitor. Click **Next**.

4. On the following page, configure an alarm based on the newly created health check.

5. Once you configure the new health check and alarm, the email address you indicated receives a confirmation email from AWS. Route53 does not execute the health check until you confirm the email address. Once the health check executes, be sure that the monitored site shows 100% health under the **Monitoring** tab.

6. Under the **Health Checkers** tab, review information in the **Status** column for each of the **Health Checker Regions** and resolve any issues.

7. If you have not already done so, configure the new alarm notification target by navigating to the **Alarms** tab and clicking the **Edit** button in the **Actions** column. Select the appropriate **Notification Target** from the drop-down list of existing targets.

8. If the endpoint becomes unhealthy and the alarm is triggered by Route 53, the specified email address receives an email notification from AWS similar to the one shown below:

Your health checks and alarms are fully-functioning.

Complete the process below to enhance Route 53 alarms with your local ATSD instance.

## Enhancing Alerts with Axibase Time Series Database

1. Install [ATSD sandbox](../route53-health-checks/README.md) with AWS integration. Configure Mail Client, Webhook user and import `rule-aws-cloudwatch-alarm.xml` using Docker `run` command.

    ```sh
    cat import/mail.properties
    ```

    ```txt
    server=mail.example.org
    port=587
    user=myuser@example.org
    password=secret
    ```

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 -p 8081:8081 \
      --name=atsd-sandbox \
      --volume=$(pwd)/import:/import \
      --env ATSD_IMPORT_PATH='https://github.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/raw/master/how-to/aws/route53-health-checks/resources/aws-route53-xml.zip,https://github.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/raw/master/how-to/aws/route53-email-notifications/resources/rule-aws-cloudwatch-alarm.xml' \
      --env COLLECTOR_IMPORT_PATH='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/master/how-to/aws/route53-health-checks/resources/job_aws_aws-route53.xml' \
      --env COLLECTOR_CONFIG='job_aws_aws-route53.xml:aws.properties' \
      axibase/atsd-sandbox:latest \
      --env EMAIL_CONFIG=mail.properties \
      --env WEBHOOK=aws-cw
    ```

    View container start log:

    ```sh
    docker log -f atsd-sandbox
    ```

    Start log displays the webhook at the end of the output:

    ```txt
    Webhooks created:
    Webhook user: aws-cw
    Webhook URL: https://aws-cw:PASSWORD@atsd_hostname:8443/api/v1/messages/webhook/aws-cw?command.date=Timestamp&json.parse=Message&exclude=Signature;SignatureVersion;SigningCertURL;SignatureVersion;UnsubscribeURL;MessageId;Message.detail.instance-id;Message.time;Message.id;Message.version
    ```

2. Configure ATSD to accept HTTPS requests from AWS infrastructure servers with a [**CA-signed**](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/administration/ssl-self-signed.html) SSL certificate. Alternatively, use the HTTP protocol when configuring the SNS subscription URL.

3. Open the **Services** drop-down list and navigate to the **Simple Notification Service** page in the **Application Integration** section of the menu.

4. Open the **Topics** page from the toolbar on the left, and click the **ARN** link of the alert to integrate.

    ![](./images/route53-slack-subscription.png)

5. In the **Subscriptions** section of the **Topic Details** page, click **Create Subscription** to enable enriched emails with contextual information. Click **Create Subscription** and use the webhook URL in the **Endpoint** field:

    ```elm
    https://aws-cw:PASSWORD@atsd_hostname:8443/api/v1/messages/webhook/aws-cw?command.date=Timestamp&json.parse=Message&exclude=Signature;SignatureVersion;SigningCertURL;SignatureVersion;UnsubscribeURL;MessageId;Message.detail.instance-id;Message.time;Message.id;Message.version
    ```

    Switch to HTTP protocol and modify the port number (default is `8088`) if the ATSD is running on a self-signed SSL certificate.

    Replace `atsd_hostname` with a valid hostname and update user password in the webhook URL above.

You are ready to start receiving detailed email notifications about endpoint health status alerts.

Follow the optional steps below to further enhance this functionality to send context-rich messages to a [collaboration service](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/rule-engine/notifications/) such as Slack or Telegram.

### Alarm Notifications in Slack

* Configure your local ATSD instance to send messages to Slack Messenger by following the [Slack Notifications](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/rule-engine/notifications/slack.html) procedure. Now, ATSD sends alarm notifications via Slack Messenger as well as email.

![](./images/route53-alert-slack.png)

### Alarm Notifications in Telegram

* Configure your local ATSD instance to send messages to Telegram Messenger by following the [Telegram Notifications](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/rule-engine/notifications/telegram.html) procedure. Now, ATSD sends alarm notifications via Telegram Messenger as well as email.

### Advanced Configuration

* To configure advanced settings, expand the **Alerts** menu and select **Rules**. Follow the procedure described by the [Notification Attachments Documentation](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/rule-engine/notifications/#attachments) to include detailed reports and portals in your alert emails.

* Enable the **Attach Details** option to include detailed email reports upon alarm notification:

![](./images/route53-alarm-email-detail.png)

* Enable the **Attach Portals** option to include complete health check portals upon alarm notification (not only unhealthy endpoints):
