Entity Views display a custom set of attributes and statistics for the members of the selected Entity Group. The information displayed by an entity view is presented in a tabular format and is updated when the page is refreshed. Entity Views can be added to the top menu. For more information on entity views, see the [documentation](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/configuration/entity_views.html).

Follow this process to upload an Entity View configuration to your local ATSD instance.

1. Expand the **Entity Views** menu from the left toolbar and select **Configure**.
