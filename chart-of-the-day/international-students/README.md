America has always been a country that thrived on immigration, and American universities are regarded among the best in
the world. International students find the middle ground of these two metrics and come to the country to experience American
life and study at some of the best American universities, sometimes returning home after they complete their education
and sometimes accepting work and joining the millions who have done the same throughout history.

But where do they come from?

```sql
SELECT tags.country AS "Country", value/1000 AS "Thousand Students"
  FROM "no_of_students"
ORDER BY value DESC
```
