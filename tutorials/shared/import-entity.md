An Entity configuration describes a monitored object. The [entity record](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/api/meta/entity/list.html#fields) includes information about the object such as the name, label, and custom tags.

Follow this process to import entity records into your local ATSD instance.

1. Click the **Entities** link in the toolbar on the left.
