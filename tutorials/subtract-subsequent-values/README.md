# Calculating the Difference Between Consecutive Series Values

## Purpose

ATSD has several alternatives to perform ad hoc calculations such as computing the difference between consecutive values for a given series.

This article demonstrates this calculation using three methods:

* [**SQL Console**](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/sql-console.html)
* [**Data API** Series: Query](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/api/data/series/query.html)
* [Charts Functions](https://github.com/axibase/charts/blob/master/README.md)

## Dataset

The sample dataset in this article is represented by:

* Entity `hetzner`
* Metric `outage-tickets`
* Series tags: `DC=07`, `DC=10`, and `DC=12`

The `outage-tickets` metric measures the number of tickets open in the service provider support desk during a power outage incident.

## SQL Console

**SQL Console** is a web-based interface to submit [SQL queries](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql) to ATSD and display the results.

```sql
SELECT datetime, value AS "VALUE", (value - LAG(value)) AS "DIFF"
  FROM "outage-tickets"
WHERE entity = 'hetzner' AND tags.dc = '07'
  ORDER BY datetime
```

Compute the difference between consecutive values with the [`LAG`](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/#lag) function. When `LAG` encounters a non-existent sample, it returns [`null`](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/#null) value.

```txt

|----------------------|------|------|
| 2018-05-24T10:43:00Z | 237  | null |
| 2018-05-24T11:29:00Z | 402  | 165  |

| 2018-05-26T13:38:00Z | 0    | -86  |
```

To filter data for another series tag, modify the `tags.dc` condition in the [`WHERE`](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/#where-clause) clause.

## Series Query

The [Series: Query](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/api/data/series/query.html) API endpoint allows you to query time series records for the specified metric, entity, tag, and interval filters.

```json
[{
    "startDate": "2018-05-24T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2018-05-27T00:00:00Z",
    "entity": "hetzner",
    "metric": "outage-tickets",
    "tags": {"dc" : "07"}
}]
```

```json

```

Add the [Rate Processor](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/api/data/series/rate.html) to compute the difference between consecutive samples per unit of time, or rate period. Omit the rate period parameter to return the difference between consecutive samples.

```json
[{
    "startDate": "2018-05-20T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2018-05-27T00:00:00Z",
    "entity": "hetzner",
    "metric": "outage-tickets",
    "tags": {"dc" : "07"},
    "rate": {
      "counter": false
     }
}]
```

```json

## Charts Functions

[Charts Syntax](https://github.com/axibase/charts/blob/master/README.md#axibase-charts) provides several alternatives to visualize the raw data and to perform delta calculations in the browser.

The `outage-tickets` dataset visualized in **ChartLab**:

To calculate and display the difference between consecutive values, there are two options.

### Create Derived Series Using replace-value

Use the `value` and `previousValue` fields in the [`replace-value`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/configuring-the-widgets/) function.

```ls
[series]
replace-value = value - previousValue
```

[![](./images/button.png)](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/af56007b#fullscreen)

### Derived Series Using Aliases

Create a derived series using the [`previous(alias)`](https://github.com/axibase/charts/blob/master/syntax/functions.md#previous) function.  Hide both the raw series and the derived series. Create a third series and calculate the difference in consecutive values for each timestamp by referencing values of the hidden series.

```ls
  # raw series data
  [series]
   alias = raw
   display = false

  # series where each value is equal to previous value
  [series]
   value = previous('raw')
   alias = prev
   display = false

  # derived series that calculated the delta
  [series]
   value = value('raw') - value('prev')
```

[![](./images/button.png)](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/a7b29712)

Both methods create the same visualization.
