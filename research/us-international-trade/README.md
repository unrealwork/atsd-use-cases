# Analyzing American International Trade History

![TitlePhoto](./images/TitlePhoto.png)

## Introduction

Buy American. Drive American. Wear American. The American economy seems to be on everybody's minds these days, namely returning jobs and money sent overseas back to the American people. Many voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential election
desired to return to a time when America was producing more than it was taking in. According to data published by the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?end=2015&start=1960&view=chart&year_high_desc=true),
the United States represented **40%** of the world's GDP in **1960**. By 2015, that number had dropped to only **24%**. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2012/01/art4full.pdf), by 2020 the U.S. is predicted to have **5.7
million** less manufacturing jobs than it had in 2000. Additionally, the percentage of Americans employed in manufacturing dropped from **19%** in 1980 to **8%** in 2016. In this article we will analyze a dataset from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov) looking at
[America's international trade balance](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/country.xlsx) from 1985 through the present day. This research article illustrates how
publicly available data from census.gov can be easily loaded into the non-relational [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/)
for interactive analysis with SQL and graphical representation of open data published by government and multilateral organizations. This article provides both sample SQL queries and charts,
as well as instructions on how to install your own ATSD instance and populate it with the underlying data.

America's International Trade Dataset

Let's take a look at a dataset on America's international trade from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/index.html).  The dataset is available as an Excel file [here](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/country.xlsx).

This dataset contains import and export statistics collected monthly from 1985 to the present time for the United States and 259 locations. These locations include countries,
world regions (such as Europe and Asia), trade unions (such as the European Union or NAFTA), as well as various other organizations (such as [OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC)).

While Excel can provide quick answers to simple questions, when it comes to complex analysis it is much more convenient to interact with the data once it is loaded into a database. The
[Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/) is a powerful tool when it comes to storing, analyzing, and visualizing datasets. We will use the following two capabilities of ATSD to work with this dataset:

* Interactive graphs from [Chart Lab](../../how-to/shared/chartlab.md);

* Tabular outputs from analytical SQL queries with support for [partitioning](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/#partitioning).

You can load the dataset into any ATSD instance by following the steps provided at the [end of the article](#action-items).

The BLS file format presents a number of challenges when loading the data. In particular, it requires the parser to handle columns that combine both metric names (E - export, I - import), as well as partial dates (3-letter months).

![csv-structure](./images/csv-structure.png)

ATSD handles this by implementing a [schema-based](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/parsers/csv/csv-schema.html) parser which can be configured to load records from non-standard CSV files, such as the BLS report.

## Overview

Let's begin by analyzing when the U.S. had its best international trade balance in recent history.

Below is an image showing import, export, and trade balance values from 1987 to 2016 between the U.S. and the sum of all countries included in this dataset.
The top image shows exports (in blue) over imports (in pink). In 2016, imports into the United States totalled **$2 trillion**, while exports were **$1.3 trillion**. The lower figure shows trade balance, which is the dollar amount for exports minus imports. The trade balance deficit grew from **-$152 billion** in 1987 to **-$677 billion** in 2016.

In addition to looking at graphical outputs, we can also perform [SQL queries](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/), which can be used
to search for specific information contained in this dataset. From the query below it may be observed that within the dataset time range, 1991 was the year which had the least negative trade balance of **-$66.7 billion**.

```sql
SELECT date_format(e.time, 'yyyy') AS "year", e.tags.ctyname AS country,
  SUM(e.value)/1000 AS export,
  SUM(i.value)/1000 AS import,
  (SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value))/1000 AS trade_balance
  FROM "us-trade-export" e
  JOIN "us-trade-import" i
WHERE e.datetime >= '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z' and e.datetime < '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  AND e.tags.cty_code = '0015'
GROUP BY e.period(1 year), e.tags
  WITH ROW_NUMBER(e.entity, e.tags ORDER BY SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value) DESC) <= 1
```

```ls
| year  | country                         | export  | import  | trade_balance |
|-------|---------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 1991  | World, Not Seasonally Adjusted  | 421.7   | 488.5   | -66.7         |
```

## Trade by Country

Let's now look at trade balance between the U.S. and individual countries.

Below is an image showing import, export, and trade balance values between the U.S. and its largest trading partner, China. In 2016, exports and imports to/from China totaled **$104 billion** and **$423 billion**, respectively.
As marked in the figure below, we can see that the trade balance deficit between the U.S. and China grew from **-$6 million** in 1985 to **-$319 billion** in 2016.

![Figure 4](./images/Figure4.png)

By clicking on the below button, you can explore the trade by any country included in this dataset. Simply click on the drop down tabs to scroll between different countries,
as well as between continents or organizations. **Note**: there are separate filters for the top and bottom graphs. You need to select your desired location from the
`US Import/Export` drop down, as well from `US Trade Balance` in order to filter.

Below is a SQL query and output showing the exports, imports, and trade balance
(all in millions USD) between United States and Mexico from 1985 to 2016:

```sql
SELECT date_format(e.time, 'yyyy') AS "year",
  e.tags.ctyname AS country,
  SUM(e.value) AS export,
  SUM(i.value) AS import,
  SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value) AS trade_balance -- apply grouped aggregation functions to calculate trade balance
FROM "us-trade-export" e
  JOIN "us-trade-import" i -- merge export and import time series using JOIN
  -- filter records by date in ISO 8601 format
WHERE e.datetime >= '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND e.datetime < '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  AND e.tags.ctyname IN ('Mexico') -- filter the data for country name = 'Mexico'
GROUP BY e.period(1 year), e.tags -- group values by year, tags (include country name and code)
  ORDER BY e.datetime DESC
```

## 2016: Year in Review

How did 2016 look for the United States? Below is a figure of the top countries for U.S. export and imports in 2016. The table to the right of the below graphs provides
monetary values for exports, imports, and the trade balance (export minus import) between the U.S. and each respective country, continent, or organization. The table is sorted by
trade balance, with the highest negative trade balances showing at the top. You may sort the table as you wish by accessing the Chart Lab portal (button below) and clicking
on the column headers.

In 2016, the locations with which the United States had the highest negative and positive trade balances were China / Hong Kong at **-$319 billion** and **$25.1 billion**,
respectively.

How did 2016 look for the United States for trade balance (in billions USD) with regions of the world as a whole:

```sql
SELECT e.tags.ctyname AS region,
  e.tags.cty_code AS code,
  SUM(e.value)/1000 AS export,
  SUM(i.value)/1000 AS import,
  (SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value))/1000 AS trade_balance
FROM "us-trade-export" e
  JOIN "us-trade-import" i
WHERE e.datetime >= '2016-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND e.datetime < '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  -- include regions (code < 1000) except regional trade unions such as OPEC, NAFTA, etc.
  AND e.tags.cty_code < '1000' AND e.tags.cty_code NOT IN ('0004', '0005', '0006', '0007', '0008', '0015', '0017')
GROUP BY e.period(1 year), e.tags
  ORDER BY region
```

```ls

| Australia and Oceania      | 0018  | 24.4    | 13.0    | 11.4          |
| Europe                     | 0012  | 291.4   | 442.6   | -151.2        |
| European Union             | 0003  | 247.4   | 381.5   | -134.1        |
| North America              | 0010  | 457.5   | 525.4   | -67.9         |
| OPEC                       | 0001  | 64.0    | 70.5    | -6.5          |
| Pacific Rim                | 0014  | 328.2   | 740.6   | -412.5        |
| South and Central America  | 0009  | 125.0   | 97.9    | 27.2          |
| Sub Saharan Africa         | 0019  | 12.4    | 18.2    | -5.8          |
```

In addition to tables output from SQL queries, we can display these continental relationships in Chart Lab graphs. Below is an image for U.S. trade export and import numbers with South and
Central America, Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America for 2016. Lines are drawn going from (exports) and coming back to (imports) the U.S. The heavier the lines
are between the U.S. and the respective continent, the greater the dollar amount in trade. We can see that 2016 exports from the U.S. to North America totaled
**$457 billion**, while imports from North America into the US totaled **$525 billion**, resulting in a trade balance deficit of **-$68 billion**. Additionally, we can see that the
heaviest lines were between the U.S. and Asia, indicating that these two have the highest trade volume between them.

## A Closer Look at America's Trading Partners

Now let's take a closer look at America's trading partners. Are there any shared characteristics between these countries?

A claim often made is that poor, developing countries are stealing American jobs and industry. If a country is poaching another country's jobs and industry, it is reasonable
to assume that the afflicted country's trade balance would change as a result. For example, the more steel manufacturing jobs that leave the U.S. for Asia, the more steel the
U.S. will need to import from Asia. In this instance, `2016_GDP_per_capita` was calculated from the following two replacement tables:
[`world-population.txt`](resources/world-population.txt) and [`world-gdp.txt`](resources/world-gdp.txt). Results are sorted by the country's `2016_trade_balance_rank`. The
more negative a country's trade balance, the higher its ranking. You can refer to the [`us-trade-balance-rank-2016.txt`](resources/us-trade-balance-rank-2016.txt) file to see these rankings.
In order to separate rich and poor countries, we calculated an average world GDP. We divided the world population
by the world's GDP to get a world GDP of $10,273. Any
countries having a GDP less than this were considered poor countries, while countries with a greater GDP were considered rich.

Here is a query showing the year with the highest trade balance (least negative or most positive, in millions USD) going back to 1985
for countries in the bottom 50% by GDP per capita (true/absolute value shown below):

```sql
SELECT e.tags.ctyname AS country,
  date_format(e.time, 'yyyy') AS "year",
  SUM(e.value) AS export, SUM(i.value) AS import, SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value) AS trade_balance,
  CAST(LOOKUP('us-trade-balance-2016', e.tags.ctyname) AS number) AS "2016_trade_balance",
  1000000*CAST(LOOKUP('world-gdp', e.tags.ctyname) AS number)/CAST(LOOKUP('world-population', e.tags.ctyname) AS number) AS "2016_GDP_per_capita",
  CAST(LOOKUP('us-trade-balance-rank-2016', e.tags.ctyname) as number) AS "2016_trade_balance_rank"
FROM "us-trade-export" e
  JOIN "us-trade-import" i
WHERE e.datetime >= '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND e.datetime < '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  AND e.tags.cty_code > '1000' AND e.tags.cty_code NOT IN ('7740', '4350', '8500', '5080', '5160', '4790', '4610', '4799', '4802', '7320', '2771', '8220')
  AND 1000000*CAST(LOOKUP('world-gdp', e.tags.ctyname) AS number)/CAST(LOOKUP('world-population', e.tags.ctyname) AS number) <= 10273
GROUP BY e.period(1 year), e.tags
  -- Use partitioning to group annual records countru and selecting one row with maximum trade balance for each country
  WITH ROW_NUMBER(e.entity, e.tags ORDER BY SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value) DESC) <= 1
  ORDER BY CAST(LOOKUP('us-trade-balance-rank-2016', e.tags.ctyname) AS number)
  LIMIT 10
```

Looking at our results, a couple of things stand out:

* We need to go back to the early 1990's for when the U.S. had the best trade balance with the world's poorest countries (1993 for Iraq is the most recent year).
* The U.S. had negative trade balances (more imports than exports) in 2016 with all of these countries.
* All of these countries have a GDP per capita of less than $8,240.9 (China).

Now, lets take a look at the most recent year the U.S. had the highest trade balance (least negative or most positive, in millions USD) for countries in the top 50% by
GDP per capita (true/absolute value shown below).

```sql
SELECT e.tags.ctyname AS country,
  date_format(e.time, 'yyyy') AS "year",
  SUM(e.value) AS export, SUM(i.value) AS import, SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value) AS trade_balance,
  CAST(LOOKUP('us-trade-balance-2016', e.tags.ctyname) AS number) AS "2016_trade_balance",
  1000000*CAST(LOOKUP('world-gdp', e.tags.ctyname) AS number)/CAST(LOOKUP('world-population', e.tags.ctyname) AS number) AS "2016_GDP_per_capita",
  CAST(LOOKUP('us-trade-balance-rank-2016', e.tags.ctyname) as number) AS "2016_trade_balance_rank"
FROM "us-trade-export" e
  JOIN "us-trade-import" i
WHERE e.datetime >= '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND e.datetime < '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  AND e.tags.cty_code > '1000' AND e.tags.cty_code NOT IN ('7740', '4350', '8500', '5080', '5160', '4790', '4610', '4799', '4802', '7320', '2771', '8220')
  AND 1000000*CAST(LOOKUP('world-gdp', e.tags.ctyname) AS number)/CAST(LOOKUP('world-population', e.tags.ctyname) AS number) > 10273
GROUP BY e.period(1 year), e.tags
  WITH ROW_NUMBER(e.entity, e.tags ORDER BY SUM(e.value)-SUM(i.value) DESC) <= 1
  ORDER BY CAST(LOOKUP('us-trade-balance-rank-2016', e.tags.ctyname) AS number)
  LIMIT 10
```

Looking at our results, a couple of things stand out:

* With the exception of 2008 for Switzerland, we need to go back to the 1990's for when the U.S. had the best trade balance with the world's richest countries.
* The U.S. had negative trade balances (more imports than exports) in 2016 with all of these countries.
* All of these countries have a GDP per capita of greater than $22,190.9 (Taiwan).

Looking at these two outputs together, we can see that the U.S. has bad trade balances with both poor and rich countries. For both poor and rich countries, we need to go back to the
early 1900's (as we found in the first query of this article) for when the U.S. had its best trade balance. While there may not be a direct correlation between
a country losing jobs and having to increase its imports, both rich and poor countries could be equally accused of taking U.S. jobs. In the top ten for trade balance rank, there
are both five poor (China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Malaysia) and rich (Japan, Germany, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy) countries included in this list.

### Additional SQL Queries

Here are some additional SQL queries (along with snippets of their outputs) which take a closer look at the U.S.'s international trade history.

Annual exports for Mexico to the United States (in millions USD).

```sql
SELECT date_format(time, 'yyyy') AS "year",
  tags.ctyname AS country,
  SUM(value) AS export
FROM "us-trade-export"
WHERE datetime >= '1985-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND datetime < '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  AND tags.ctyname IN ('Mexico')
GROUP BY period(1 year), tags
  ORDER BY datetime DESC
```
