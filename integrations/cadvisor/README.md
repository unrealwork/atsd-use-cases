# Integrating ATSD with Google cAdvisor

Axibase Time Series Database (ATSD) provides a native storage driver to collect Docker container metrics from [Google cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) for long-term retention, alerting, and visualization.

Google cAdvisor is a lightweight containerized application, written in `golang`, that reads CPU, memory, network and disk I/O counters from the Linux operating system and makes the counters available for real-time viewing using the built-in web interface. cAdvisor can be optionally configured to persist counters in one or multiple storage systems.

Both ATSD and cAdvisor are available as Docker containers.

## Installation Steps

### Deployment Modes

* Single Host

    ATSD and Google cAdvisor containers can be launched on the same server to collect metrics from the underlying Docker host.

* Multiple Hosts

    To consolidate metrics from multiple Docker hosts, configure cAdvisor containers to send data to a centralized ATSD
    instance. This deployment mode enables centralized performance and availability monitoring.

### Launch ATSD Container

```bash
docker run \
  -d \
  -p 8088:8088 \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -p 8082:8082/udp \
  -h atsd \
  --name=atsd \
  axibase/atsd
```

Watch for **ATSD start completed** message in the `start.log`.

```bash
docker logs -f atsd
```

For more options, refer to ATSD [Docker installation](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/installation/docker.html) instructions.

The ATSD web interface is accessible on port `8443`.

### Launch cAdvisor Containers

Launch cAdvisor containers on the monitored Docker hosts to send data into the target ATSD server.

Replace `{ATSD_HOSTNAME}` placeholder in the command below with the hostname of the ATSD server.

```bash
docker run \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --publish=8080:8080 \
  --detach=true \
  --name=cadvisor \
  axibase/cadvisor:latest \
  --storage_driver=atsd \
  --storage_driver_atsd_protocol=tcp \
  --storage_driver_host={ATSD_HOSTNAME} \
  --storage_driver_buffer_duration=15s \
  --housekeeping_interval=15s
```

> The `axibase/cadvisor` image is a modified version of the `google/cadvisor` image that includes the ATSD storage driver.

#### Change Protocol

By default, the data is transmitted into ATSD over the TCP protocol on port `8081`. If necessary, modify the launch command to send data over [HTTP or HTTPS](./cadvisor-atsd-http.md) protocol.

#### Linked Containers

In case of a single-host installation, add `--link` variable and replace `{ATSD_HOSTNAME}` placeholder with `atsd` in the above command as follows:

```bash
docker run \
  ...
  --link atsd:atsd \
  --name=cadvisor \
  axibase/cadvisor:latest \
...
  --storage_driver_host=atsd \
```

### Verify Integration

* Log in to ATSD web interface at `https://atsd_hostname:8443`.
* Open the **Metrics** tab in the main menu and search for metrics that start with `cadvisor`.
* Open the **Entities** tab in the main menu.
* Select `cadvisor-hosts` in **Entity-Group** drop-down list.
* Click **Portal** icons to view the build-in cAdvisor portals.

> Disk metrics are only collected from containers with attached volumes.

## Quick Start

To quickly start both ATSD and cAdvisor on the same Docker host, use the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file.

Download the `docker-compose.yml` file to start ATSD and cAdvisor containers as a bundled service.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/master/integrations/cadvisor/docker-compose.yml \
  -o docker-compose.yml
```

Start containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Check output to ensure that containers are created.

## Collected cAdvisor Metrics

### CPU Metrics

CPU metrics from `cpuacct` controller. CPU usages is generated by the processes of the container, broken down between `user` and `system` time. User is the time during which the processes are in direct control of the CPU, and system is the time during which the CPU executed system calls on behalf of those processes. Those times are expressed in `ticks` of 1/100th of a second.

```txt
cpu.loadaverage
cpu.loadaverage%
cpu.usage.percpu
cpu.usage.percpu%
cpu.usage.system
cpu.usage.system%
cpu.usage.total
cpu.usage.total%
cpu.usage.user
cpu.usage.user%
cpu.host.usage.system%
cpu.host.usage.total%
cpu.host.usage.user%
```

### I/O Metrics

I/O is accounted in the `blkio` controller.

`io_service_bytes` – indicates the number of bytes read and written by the cgroup. It has 4 counters per device, because for each device, it differentiates between synchronous vs. asynchronous I/O, and reads vs. writes.

`io_serviced` – the number of I/O operations performed, regardless of their size. It also has 4 counters per device.

```txt
diskio.ioservicebytes.async
diskio.ioservicebytes.read
diskio.ioservicebytes.sync
diskio.ioservicebytes.total
diskio.ioservicebytes.write
diskio.ioserviced.async
diskio.ioserviced.read
diskio.ioserviced.sync
diskio.ioserviced.total
diskio.ioserviced.write
```

### Memory Metrics

Memory metrics are found in the “memory” cgroup.

`pgfault` and `pgmajfault` – indicate the number of times that a process of the cgroup triggered a page fault and a major fault. A page fault happens when a process accesses a part of its virtual memory space which is nonexistent or protected.

`memory.usage` – the amount of all used memory, regardless of access time.

`memory.usage` – the amount of memory that a processes require in a given time interval. This includes recently accessed memory, dirty memory and kernel memory.

```txt
memory.containerdata.pgfault
memory.containerdata.pgmajfault
memory.hierarchicaldata.pgfault
memory.hierarchicaldata.pgmajfault
memory.usage
memory.workingset
cadvisor.memory.cache
cadvisor.memory.rss
```

### Network Metrics

Network metrics track the about of packets received/sent, amount of traffic in bytes, dropped packets and errors.

`network.rxbytes` – cumulative count of bytes received.
`network.rxpackets` – cumulative count of packets received.
`network.rxerrors` – cumulative count of receive errors encountered.
`network.rxdropped` – cumulative count of packets dropped while receiving.
`network.txbytes` – cumulative count of bytes transmitted.
`network.txpackets` – cumulative count of packets transmitted.
`network.txerrors` – cumulative count of transmit errors encountered.
`network.txdropped` – Cumulative count of packets dropped while transmitting.

### Task Metrics

`taskstats.nriowait` – number of tasks waiting on I/O.
`taskstats.nrrunning` – number of running tasks.
`taskstats.nrsleeping` – number of sleeping tasks.
`taskstats.nrstopped` – number of tasks in stopped state.
`taskstats.nruninterruptible` – number of tasks in uninterruptible state.

### File System Metrics

File system metrics track the read and write processes for attached file systems.

```txt
filesystem.available
filesystem.ioinprogress
filesystem.iotime
filesystem.limit
filesystem.readscompleted
filesystem.readsmerged
filesystem.readtime
filesystem.sectorsread
filesystem.sectorswritten
filesystem.usage
filesystem.weightediotime
filesystem.writescompleted
filesystem.writesmerged
filesystem.writetime
cadvisor.filesystem.baseusage
cadvisor.filesystem.inodesfree
```

> disk metrics and file system metrics are only collected from containers that have attached volumes.
